# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
A real-time driver drowsiness detection system that combines **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** method to monitor driver alertness and prevent accidents caused by fatigue.

## Detection Method
### **1. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**

### **2. EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio)** 

### **3. Hybrid Approach (CNN + EAR)** 
- Combines strengths of both methods
- CNN for complex pattern recognition
- EAR for precise eye state measurement
- Improved accuracy and reduced false positives

## Dataset
- **Drowsiness Prediction Dataset**
This dataset includes 4560 Active Subjects and 4560 Fatigue Subjects.

- **Data Preprocessing**
